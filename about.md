Hi, my name is Bobby Wagner. I am currently a Junior computer science major at Case Western Reserve University.

Currently I perform research on distributional semantics in the lab of Soumya Ray.

During Summer 2018 I am scheduled to intern at Yelp on one of the Data Backend teams.

My resume can be found [here](https://bobby-wagner.com/resume)
