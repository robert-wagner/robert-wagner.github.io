Hi, my name is Bobby Wagner. I am currently a senior computer science major at Case Western Reserve University scheduled to graduate in December 2018.

During Summer 2018 I interned at Yelp on their User Location Intelligence team where I used distributed systems to analyze location data in realtime.

My resume can be found [here](http://bobby-wagner.com/resume)
