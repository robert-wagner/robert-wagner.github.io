Hi, my name is Bobby Wagner. I am passionate about building software products which are used every day. 

My latest role was leading the infrastructure team at a stealth machine learning startup. In this role I focused on building a self serve platform for deployment on top of Kubernetes and ArgoCD

Before joining this startup I spent two years as a core contributor to [OpenMined](openmined.org) where I worked on building tools for privacy preserving machine learning including tensors which worked with multiparty computation, servers for orchestrating federated learning, and tooling to make it easier to develop a codebase with >100 contributors.  

During Summer 2018 I interned at Yelp on their User Location Intelligence team where I used distributed systems to analyze location data in realtime.

I studied computer science at Case Western Reserve University and graduated in January 2019.
